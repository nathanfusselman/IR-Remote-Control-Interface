# IR-Remote-Control-Interface
 Bidirectional NEC Remote Control Interface built for TM4C123GH6PM

 The University of Texas at Arlington | Junior Year | CSE 3442 | Embedded I
 This Project was programed in C for bare metal operation on the TI Tiva Development Board.
 This project was developed and created in CCStudio.

# Overview
 This project was designed to interface an NEC remote control with your computer
 by accepting input signals and transmitting the decoded information via UART to
 the connected computer. This device is also capable of transmitting saved codes
 to other nearby devices. The device is able to save 255 total codes in its
 internal EEPROM for non-volatile storage. This project could be expanded by
 allowing this device to communicate with a similar board that is connected to
 the internet and allow for remote non line of sight communication with IR
 capable devices.
